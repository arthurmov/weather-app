# Weather App - README

This Weather App is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check the current weather for any city in the world. 
Users can input the name of a city, and the app fetches real-time weather data from a weather API. The app displays the temperature, weather conditions, and other 
relevant details. It uses standard JavaScript for handling API requests, and CSS for styling the user interface. 
To use the app, simply enter the city name in the input field and hit submit to get the current weather information.
